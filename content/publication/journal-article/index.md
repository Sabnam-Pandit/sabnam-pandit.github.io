# 🎓 I Just Graduated! A Journey of Growth, Grit, and Gratitude

*Reflections from my Master’s in Big Data Analytics at San Diego State University*

---

## The Beginning: Excitement, Nervousness, and Determination

I just graduated with my Master’s in **Big Data Analytics** from SDSU! After months of hard work, late-night coding sessions, and unforgettable memories, I’m finally holding that diploma in my hands.  

I still remember opening my admission email — a mix of excitement, nervousness, and sheer determination. Orientation at **Storm Hall** was the official beginning. Meeting my cohort — brilliant minds from around the world — was overwhelming in the best way possible.  

> “By the end of this journey, I didn’t just earn a degree — I began shaping myself into a Data Scientist.”

From day one, I told myself: *“Give it your all.”* I had come to a new country, full of opportunities, determined to make the most of it.

## 💻 Experiences That Shaped Me

### My First Project: Image Caption Generation with Custom Music Recommendation

I was a complete beginner, learning, stumbling, and doubting myself — but the joy of finally seeing it work was unforgettable.  

Those late nights spent debugging code were intense. When the model finally ran, a mix of relief, triumph, and confidence washed over me — a true *‘bring it on’* feeling.

### Research with San Diego Zoo

Working with my professor on a project in collaboration with the **San Diego Zoo Safari Park** was surreal. Driving to the park to present our findings gave me my first taste of academic research and boosted my confidence to share work publicly.

### GMIS Conference & Teaching Assistant Experience

Attending **GMIS (Great Minds in STEM)** was inspiring — filled with knowledge, networking, and a glimpse into what’s possible.  

Being a Teaching Assistant for **Advanced Programming Languages** was terrifying at first, but every week I gained more confidence. Proctoring an in-person exam for 65 students on my own was a small victory that whispered, *“Hey, maybe you could teach someday.”*

## 🔄 Lessons I’d Share With My Past Self

While I’m proud of my journey, there are a few things I’d approach differently:

- 🎓 **It’s not just about the course — it’s about the professor.**  
  Research teaching styles and past student experiences; mentorship matters.

- 📚 **Take a class from a professor you admire.**  
  Don’t wait. Reach out early and find ways to collaborate.

- 💼 **Start preparing for internships immediately.**  
  Resume, cover letters, LinkedIn — start early. Timing can make all the difference.

- 💡 **Ask for help and take risks.**  
  Growth comes from stepping out of your comfort zone.

## 🏅 BDA Excellence Award & What’s Next

I’m thrilled to share that I graduated with a **4.0 GPA** and received the **BDA Excellence Certificate**, a proud moment symbolizing all the effort, perseverance, and growth over the past two years.  

Now, I’m ready to dive into the real world — eager to apply my skills, discover new ones, and explore the full extent of my potential. The learning doesn’t stop here. I’m on it. 💪

## ✨ Reflections

Two years ago, I was nervous about stepping into a new country, a new educational system, and an entirely new field. Today, I’m grateful — for the challenges, the failures, the late nights, the mentors, and the friends who made this journey unforgettable.  

> *“Embrace every moment. The struggles, the excitement, the tiny wins — they all shape you in ways you’ll only realize later.”*

To anyone reading this who’s about to embark on a similar path: keep learning, stay curious, and trust the process.
