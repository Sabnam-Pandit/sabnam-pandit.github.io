title: 🎓 I Just Graduated! A Journey of Growth, Grit, and Gratitude
summary: I just graduated with my Master’s in Big Data Analytics from San Diego State University! After months of hard work, sleepless nights, and unforgettable memories, I’m finally holding that diploma in my hands. These two years have been nothing short of amazing.

I still remember the moment I got my admission email — the mix of excitement, nervousness, and sheer determination. Orientation at Storm Hall was the beginning of it all. I met my cohort for the first time — brilliant minds from around the world, each bringing unique experiences and perspectives. It was overwhelming in the best way possible.

From the start, I told myself: “Give it your all.” And I did. I came to a new country — a land of opportunities — determined to make the most of it. And by the end of this journey, I didn’t just earn a degree, I began becoming a Data Scientist.

## 💻 Experiences That Shaped Me
Looking back, I’m proud of how far I’ve come. I worked on some truly exciting projects — starting with my very first one, “Image Caption Generation with Custom Music Recommendation.” I was a complete beginner — learning, stumbling, doubting — but the joy of finally seeing it work was incredible.

Then came a turning point: working on a research project with my professor in collaboration with San Diego Zoo. Driving to San Diego Zoo Safari Park to present our work was surreal. It gave me my first real taste of academic research and boosted my confidence to share my work publicly.

I also got the opportunity to attend GMIS (Great Minds in STEM) — an enriching experience filled with inspiration and learning. And being a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Programming Languages? That was a whole new adventure. I was nervous (read: terrified!) at first. But with every passing week, I became more confident. I even proctored an in-person exam for 65 students all by myself — and honestly, a little voice inside me said, “Hey, this isn’t bad... maybe I can be a professor someday!”

Grading Data Science assignments, working alongside people from diverse backgrounds, and navigating through cultures — I realized the power of networking. You build relationships, give your best, and doors open. For me, many things happened organically, but I now see that networking is an art. Hats off to those who’ve mastered it.

## 🔄 If I Could Do It All Over Again...
While I’m incredibly proud of my journey, there are a few things I would approach differently if I had to do it all again — especially as an international student adjusting to a new educational system:

👉 It’s not just about the course — it’s about the professor.
Take time to research the professor’s background, teaching style, and student reviews.

📚 Take a class from a professor you admire.
Don’t wait for the “perfect” time. If someone inspires you, reach out early and find ways to collaborate.

💼 Start preparing for internships the moment you start your program.
I know it sounds early, but trust me — by the time you’ve perfected your resume and cover letters, it’ll be peak application season. Early prep means better opportunities.

## 🏅 BDA Excellence Award & What’s Next
I’m thrilled to share that I graduated with a 4.0 GPA and received the BDA Excellence Certificate — a proud moment that symbolizes all the effort, perseverance, and growth I’ve experienced over these past two years.

Now, I’m ready to dive into the real world — eager to apply my skills, discover new ones, and explore the full extent of my potential.

The learning doesn't stop here. I’m on it. 💪
