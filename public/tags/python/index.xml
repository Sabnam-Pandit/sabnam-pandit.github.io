The goal is to help readers find books they are more likely to enjoy by accurately classifying books into their respective genres. We fine-tuned multiple pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT) to achieve this task.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Energy Consumption and Generation Prediction based on Weather Conditions</title><link>https://sabnam-pandit.github.io/sabnampandit/project/energypred/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sabnam-pandit.github.io/sabnampandit/project/energypred/</guid><description>&lt;p>This project aims to predict energy consumption and generation based on weather conditions in Spain, using machine learning algorithms and the Kaggle dataset &amp;ldquo;Hourly energy demand generation and weather&amp;rdquo;.
